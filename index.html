   <p>
       I want to show my interests in the page like animation and music. I will show it by picture and video.<br/>
       And I will record my everyday learning content in the page to survey my learning state,too.
   </p>

   <p>
       <big>Now let's show somethings that is interesting and which can make our boring learning journey more colorful and beautiful.</big>

       <big>
           Why don't we use the page to record the knowledge? <br/>Just like the project in Github.Making a notebook page?<br/> It's cool.
